# Roulette

This is a trainride project, which I made on my ways to work.

The purpose is to show that you can not win long-term in roulette,
no matter for how many misses you wait or how often you double your stake.

## TODO:
 - Game Log: highlight when it is blown up
 - Services: create Abstract Service with CRUD functions
 - Live Mode: allow to enter number by number and get where you should place a bet
 - load the data always with observables (as well from local storage)

- adjust shadow to be the same
- remove folding box
